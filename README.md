# CloudNet Monitor

A Comprehensive Architectural Blueprint for a Secure, Cloud-Hosted Network Monitoring Dashboard

## Overview

CloudNet Monitor is a modern network observability platform that provides real-time monitoring and historical analysis of network infrastructure. It supports multi-vendor environments and provides visibility across network hardware, servers, cloud infrastructure, and applications.

## Architecture

### High-Level System Architecture

The system follows a modular, multi-layered architecture:

1. **Data Collection Layer**: Gathers telemetry data using SNMP, NetFlow/IPFIX/sFlow, and active monitoring
2. **Data Processing and Storage Layer**: Time-series database for metrics + PostgreSQL for metadata
3. **Backend API and Logic Layer**: Node.js/Express for real-time API + Python for data processing
4. **Presentation Layer**: React frontend with interactive data visualizations

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js/Express (real-time API), Python (data processing)
- **Frontend**: React with Recharts for visualization
- **Database**: InfluxDB/Amazon Timestream (time-series) + PostgreSQL (metadata)
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS (VPC, ECS, RDS, Lambda)
- **Monitoring Protocols**: SNMP, NetFlow/IPFIX, sFlow, Active monitoring

## Key Features

### Core Monitored Components
- Network Hardware (routers, switches, firewalls)
- Servers (physical and virtual)
- Cloud Infrastructure (VMs, containers, managed services)
- Applications and URLs
- Endpoints (printers, UPS, IoT devices)

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Availability**: Device status, server uptime, interface status
- **Performance**: Bandwidth utilization, latency, packet loss, error rates
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU load, memory consumption, disk usage
- **Traffic Analysis**: Throughput, packet rates, top talkers
- **Wireless Metrics**: Wi-Fi connectivity, channel utilization

## Quick Start

### 🚀 Deploy to Render (Recommended)

The fastest way to get CloudNet Monitor running in production **completely FREE**:

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/TejaswiBhavani/cloudnet-monitor)

**✨ 100% Free Deployment**:
- Render free tier (backend + database + frontend)
- InfluxDB Cloud free tier (metrics storage)
- **Total cost: $0/month** 🎉

**Prerequisites**: 
- GitHub account
- Render account (free tier)
- InfluxDB Cloud account (free tier)

**Steps**:
1. Click the deploy button above
2. Sign up for [InfluxDB Cloud](https://cloud.influxdata.com)
3. Configure InfluxDB environment variables in Render
4. Access your deployed application

### 🐳 Local Development with Docker

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.9+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- AWS CLI (for cloud deployment)

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TejaswiBhavani/cloudnet-monitor.git
cd cloudnet-monitor
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
# Backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install

# Python dependencies
cd ../data-processing
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the development environment:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`

### Production Deployment

The system is designed for deployment on AWS using:
- Amazon ECS for containerized services
- Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL
- Amazon Timestream for time-series data
- Amazon VPC for secure networking
- AWS Lambda for data processing functions

See `docs/deployment.md` for detailed deployment instructions.
